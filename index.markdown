# Alex Laitenberger

## AI / NLP Research

I'm a researcher in Natural Language Processing with a focus on improving the truthfulness of language models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), agentic multi-step reasoning pipelines and fact verification systems. I recently co-authored a Stanford-affiliated paper on RAG evaluation with Christopher D. Manning (Stanford) and Nelson F. Liu (OpenAI/Stanford), which has been published at the EMNLP 2025 Main Conference in Suzhou, China. The work investigated how simple, well-designed methods can outperform more complex RAG systems in long-context QA tasks, and introduces a strong baseline to support future research in advanced RAG methods.

I'm currently open to research opportunities in both academia and industry — particularly roles involving the improvement of truthfulness and factual accuracy of language models, their applications in RAG, agentic reasoning, and fact verification systems. Long term, I remain excited about contributing to foundational research in NLP and AI — whether through academic institutions or top-tier AI research labs working at the frontier of language model development.
